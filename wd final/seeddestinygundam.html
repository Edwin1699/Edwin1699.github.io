This Gundam is piloted by an Ace Pilot named Shinn Asuka, who's aim is for a better future. After fighting with Ace Pilot Kira Yamato many times in the Seed Destiny Gundam (Kira weilding Gundam Strike Freedom), they join forces after understanding that one another have been fighting over the wrong reasons.
