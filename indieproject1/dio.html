		Is just wonderfully evil for the sake of being evil. He's campy, over the top, and he freaking loves every second he spends destroying people's lives. It helps that rather than jumping straight to power mad "a God am I" DIO we get to see Dio Brando first which helps flesh out the character he would become while giving us a better understanding of his motives and future behavior. He's a great example of a pure evil villain done right where you hate him and can't wait to see what horrible thing he's going to do next at the same time. Also the memes bruh, the memes.

		I don’t think you need relatability to make a good villain. Darth Vader in Empire Strikes Back and Hannibal Lecter in Silence of the Lambs had basically none, yet are still some of the most memorable villains in fiction. The thing about DIO, that is only touched upon in Part I, but explored in-depth in Parts III and VI, is his status as god-like figure in this Cult of personality dedicated to him. While he starts as just en egocentric sociopathic cunt, when he gains the powers of the Stone Mask, and later of his Stand. DIO goes full blown megalomaniac. DIO sees himself as a god among insects, he values people based on how useful they are to him. His motivation and main objective in life is to reshape the world in his own image. That’s DIO. He sees himself as God. His cronies see him as God. He wants everyone to see him as one too.

		In an interview, Araki expressed dislike for villains that the protagonist and audience could empathize with. He used Kira Yoshikage as an example, believing the strongest characters pursue, relentlessly, their resolves. If Josuke were to feel sorry for Kira, then Kira would surpass him by neglecting pity. He loved that Kira could have trauma that led to where he was and maintain an attitude of 'I am a murderer and I am okay with this. I think this is where Dio stops being one dimensional. He's aware of his poor upbringing and temper, but more so he's obsessed with his passion for greed and control. Yes, he is born evil as Speedwagon and Wang Chan mentioned, but he consistently chooses to stay in this realm of evil. The amount of respect he has for Pucci, Jonathan, and his minions in Part 3 show he can manage his aggression. There's also something to say about choosing to keep Jonathan's body, who represents the vice of evil as his own. It's also heart warming to read his interactions with Jonathan.
