	<a href="https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/RX-0_Unicorn_Gundam" target=_blank">Unicorn Gundam</a>, the only Gundam that has actual unicorn like horns, is one of the many Gundams that transform upon unleashing its power. The difference is that this Gundam during its transformation looks exactly like many other Gundams, with two golden like horns and the standard eye monitors. This suit is piloted by Banagher Links, who aims to free his friend from her family, Neo Zeon, a force causing war in the systems. This is the suit that defeats Amuro Ray's primary antagonist in the first Gundam series, Char Aznable. But it isn't the true Char, but a clone.
