		On the other hand is the opposite of DIO and most other Jojo villains. He has no schemes for world domination, no legions of minions, and he'd rather just avoid fighting and "unnecessary" killing because it's messy and puts him at risk of no longer being able to lead the lifestyle hes grown accustomed too. He's also the opposite of most villains in that rather than being loud and fabulous he's more quiet, unassuming, and "normal" holding a steady job and just going about his daily routine the way any one of us would. The scary thing is that there are sociopaths like Kira in our world which makes him a very human villain despite him having psychic goast powers. If DIO succeeded in killing Jonathan or Jotaro or if Kars had killed Joseph they'd have gone on to conquer/destroy the world, if Kira had won the only thing that would happen is he'd continue merrily killing people for the rest of his life while the world at large remained unaware. Also both have iconic/awesome stands that, generally, make sense and don't require a huge amount of explanation. The World stops time, Killer Queen makes things explode; shit just works.
