		What makes Vegeta so compelling is how blatantly he grows over the course of the series. His change is so dramatic that its hard not to pay attention to him. At the same time, Dragon Balls brisk pace (in the manga, at least) can make it difficult to digest every moment that ultimately makes Vegeta the man he becomes by the end of the Majin Boo arc.

		I don't really have the ability to write up a detail accurate discussion post but I'm giving it my best shot.Vegeta's best character moments to me are categorized this way: 
		<ol>
		<li>When he's being a true warrior with epic motivational beats like the Final Flash in Z or the Majin Vegeta vs SSJ2 Goku fight. </li>
		<li>When he is displaying that he cares about something more than his own strength, i.e friendship/family. Best examples of this are of course the Final Explosion in Z and IMO the moments in the DBS Future Trunks Arc anime or manga. In the anime it would be something like his speech to Trunks about the next threat after Black and to always keep training or in the manga when Trunks tells Vegeta about Future Bulma always wanting to see him.</li>
		</ol>
		These moments show very different aspects of Vegeta that harmonize to create one of the most emotionally driven characters around. And it's really cool when he's done well.

		I feel like Super has been the payoff for all his character development. He's finally dropped his guard and is willing to feel and be happy with the family he's made and the relationships he's earned. He's gotten the opportunity to let loose and be a member of the team, and not just the outcast. He's finally at home. His relationship with Bulma and their overall dynamic feels the most rewarding.
	</p>
	<p class="p4">
		I think it's because the chip he'd been carrying on his shoulder for so long was finally gone. He's finally accepted who he is. He's finally willing to go outside his comfort zone (like accepting and actually seeking out a master for once) and he's willing to team up for the greater good(fusion and his combos with Goku in the TOP). And the current manga I think has him going even further outside his normal comfort zone
