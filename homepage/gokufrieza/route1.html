		<h1>A Quick Sense</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>
			You begin to sense your friend <strong>Krillin</strong> and your son <strong>Gohan</strong>, but something is not right. They seem to be in danger, surrounded by three unkown beings. You also sense <strong>Vegeta</strong>, but he doesn't seem to be attacking Krillin and Gohan. You begin to make your way to the scene. 

			<h4>The fighting has begun</h4>
			
			
			As soon as you make your way to the scene, you see a losing battle between Vegeta and the ginyu force members <strong>Recoome</strong>, <strong>Jeice</strong>, and <strong>Burter</strong>. Oddly enough, it is only Recoome who is fighting while the others watch the onslaught. You have two choices, watch Vegeta get beat down by Recoome, or step in and see how you fair against the beast.
