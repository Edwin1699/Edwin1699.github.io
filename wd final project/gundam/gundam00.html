	As one of the oddest Gundam series, also separating itself from the main timeline (Universal Century), <a href="https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_00" target=_blank">Gundam 00</a> takes its series into action against "innovators", a race of super human beings who puppet the first season of the series in the background perfectly. The pilot himself is an innovator, a pure one who joins Celestial Being to pilot 00 Gundam. His name is Setsuna F. Seiei and his one wish is to eradicate war.
